# Intro to Instana Observability for Event Streams (Kafka) Messaging

This is a brief introduction to how you can observe your Event Streams Deployment along with applications in a simulated "Day 2" operations mode.

In this exercise, you will see how Instana can monitor: OCP, Kafka Brokers, Zookeeper, Kafka Connect and custom deployed applications.

In order to proceed with the demo, an Instana instance and OCP cluster are required.

If you want to deploy an Instana VM server, you can use [this Techzone guide](https://techzone.ibm.com/collection/instana-selfdeployon-vsi).

After you install an Instana environment, you need to deploy an Instana agent on yout OCP cluster. To install the agent on your OCP cluster, you can automatically generate the list of resourcers from your Instana insance:

* Access the Instana console with the provided credential and click on the top-right button "Deploy Agent"

![](./images/Instana-console-1.png){: style="width:100%"}
        
![](./images/Instana-console-2.png){: style="width:100%"}
* Select OpenShift, Technology YAML
* Insert a name for your OCP cluster
* Download the yaml to be applied
* Connect with OC CLI to your OCP cluster where the agent will be installed

`$ oc login --token=<token> --server=<url>`

* Apply the downloaded instana-agent.yaml

`$ oc apply -f instana-agent.yaml`


The agent will create an OCP project (instana-agent) and will deploy a set of resources 

If you connect to your Instana console, after a couple of minutes, you will start receive info from your OCP cluster.


## Access the Instana Instance connected to the Event Streams Cluster

1. Go directly to [Instana Home Page](https://training-kafka.instana.io/)   

1. Login using user id: trainerintegration@gmail.com and the password given to you by the instructors.<br>  Note: all attendees will use the same login credentials. <br>After you login you should see something like the following.
